# Penrose Triangle

## Overview 
CSS makes even the impossible possible. Can you find out how it was done?

## Approach
- Make six bars. Call these `penrose-bars` and call each by `penrose-bar-#`.
- Add a shorter bar of same thickness to mask the overlap.
- Skew, rotate and translate the bars to form a seamless penrose triangle.
- Apply normal and `:hover` styles on the penrose image.

## Things to improve
- Find a better way to construct this without pixel-pushing.
